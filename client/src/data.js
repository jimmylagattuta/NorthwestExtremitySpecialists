            "Ligaments perform a very important function, especially in joints. When a ligament supporting a joint is severely stretched or torn, you will lose stability and range of motion in the joint. This can make it difficult—if not impossible—to use the joint effectively without pain. When rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications are not enough to ease pain and improve mobility, surgical reconstruction of the damaged tissue might be necessary to restore function. Ligament reconstruction is most commonly used to treat injuries to the following ligaments:"

The PCL can be sprained or torn when the knee is hyperextended in an awkward landing or in a direct blow to the flexed knee. PCL injuries often also involve joint dislocation and require surgery.",

Ligament reconstruction can often be performed arthroscopically, meaning only small incisions are made in the area, and micro-tools are used, guided by a tiny camera. It can take several months to fully recover from ligament reconstruction. Recovery will involve a rehabilitation program to help you slowly break in the tissue and teach you to protect yourself from future injury."

This tough band of tissue connects the back of the femur (in your thigh) to the front of the tibia (in your shin), stabilizing the knee joint and preventing it from rotating as you walk, run, jump, kick, pivot, and perform other movements. Unfortunately, doing so much puts the ACL at risk for injuries ranging from small, partial tears to total ruptures that cause the ligament and bone to begin to separate from the rest of the joint. Complete and near-complete tears are most common—and because these injuries don’t heal on their own and, if left untreated, can increase the risk for osteoarthritis, meniscal damage, and other knee problems—and surgical reconstruction of the ligament may be required."

            "Unlike procedures from the 1970s, in which surgeons attempted to repair torn ACLs with sutures, today’s ACL surgeries are less invasive and much more effective. Rather than trying to fix a damaged ligament—which historically failed nearly 50 percent of the time—modern reconstruction procedures replace the ACL with a tendon graft from your own body (known as an autograft) or from donor tissue (called an allograft) with a much higher rate of success. Additionally, most ACL reconstructions are now minimally invasive, thanks to the use of knee arthroscopy. This technique uses tiny high-definition cameras and surgical instruments—inserted through small incisions, called portals, in the skin—to help surgeons visualize and treat issues inside the knee joint. After removing the damaged ACL and replacing it with a graft, surgeons use screws or other fixation devices to anchor the graft in place while it grows into the surrounding bone. Because minimally-invasive ACL reconstruction involves less trauma to tissues than traditional or open surgery, patients can often heal faster and return to normal activities sooner."

However, ACL reconstruction is typically recommended for young athletes and fitness enthusiasts of any age who hope to return to a high level of activity. Of course, you don’t have to be a top-performing athlete to appreciate the benefits ACL reconstruction can offer. After an ACL injury, surgical intervention can relieve pain, restore range of motion, enable a safe return to activity, prevent re-injury or additional injuries, and reduce the risk of knee arthritis or instability in the future."

For example, it allows the upper extremity to flex and extend, perform internal and external rotations, rotate in a full circle, and move toward and away from the midline of the body. In fact, this hardworking joint does so much and does it so well that you may not even notice how often you use your shoulder until an injury, illness, or other problem causes it to stop working the way it should.

Bad cases of plantar fasciitis that are not adequately addressed early may reach this stage, along with other painful conditions, such as Achilles tendinitis. When EPAT is used over a painful area, the energy pulses create “microtraumas” deep within the soft tissues that have become chronically inflamed. This triggers an accelerated response from neighboring cells. Metabolism and circulation increase. A flood of oxygen and nutrients rush in, leading to the ultimate healing of the damaged tissues. We’ve found this treatment option highly effective for even chronic and severe heel pain, as well as pain in other parts of the feet and ankles.

More than 30 million Americans are believed to live with the disease—some diagnosed, some not—and another 80 to 90 million have elevated blood sugar levels that may eventually reach Type 2 status. Diabetes can cause health problems throughout the body, with feet being one of the most vulnerable locations. That’s because diabetes shuts down circulation and damages nerves, especially in the toes and feet. Suddenly, injuries and wounds take a lot longer to heal—and without healthy nerves, you may not even realize you have a problem. If you don’t get care in time, you may risk losing a foot or limb to amputation, or developing a serious foot deformity (Charcot foot). Fortunately, most serious diabetic foot and ankle complications can be prevented with a combination of healthy habits and regular care from a podiatrist.

            "Ledderhose Disease, also known as Plantar Fibromatosis or Morbus Ledderhose is a disease in which painful hard nodules form on the bottom of the foot. The cause of this disease is not known but there are a number of known characteristics The nodules can start as small pea size nodules but gradually increase in size to marble-shaped or larger lesions. The lesions are benign. The term “fibroma” refers to a growth consisting of fibrous or scar tissue. Patients can have multiple lesions. The fibromas can occur on one or both feet. There are similarities to another disease process in the hand known as Dupuytrens Contacture.* The nodules appear to be composed of fibrous tissue or aggressive scar tissue. The lesions, when surgically removed, have a high recurrence rate. The incidence of Ledderhose Disease compared to Dupuytrens is relatively low so there is a paucity of research and literature on the subject. As a provider of the latest most effective treatments, we at NES are one of the few clinics in the Pacific Northwest that offers this treatment option.The physicians at NES utilize an injectable enzyme (hyaluronidase) mixed with a local anesthetic and a cortisone medication to effectively reduce the size of fibromas and the pain associated with plantar fibromatosis."
